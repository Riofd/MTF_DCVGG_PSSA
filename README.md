Source code of ``Encoding Time Series as Images: A Robust and Transferable Framework for Power System DIM Identification Combining Rules and VGGNet``. Our work is a application in the field of power system simulation data analysis. Specifically, to identify the dominant instability mode of power systems, especially distuighing the transient instability and short-term voltage instability. For more details about the problem, you can read our published paper on IJEPES and TPWRS which are presented blow.
